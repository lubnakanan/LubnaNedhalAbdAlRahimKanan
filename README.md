**Task Description:**

The task involved developing an **Employee Management and Vacation Workflow System** using a .NET Core application. The system includes features for managing employee data, vacation requests, and vacation types. It was built using CodeSpaces on GitHub for a cloud-based development environment. The goal was to create a system where vacation requests could be submitted, approved, or declined, with proper data storage, retrieval, and updates using Entity Framework Core.

**Solution Overview:**

1. **System Architecture**: 
   - The project follows a **layered architecture**, using **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** for organizing the code. 
   - The **Models** represent the core entities such as `VacationType`, `VacationRequest`, and `Employee`, with data annotations for validation.
   - The **Repositories** handle data access, where `IVacationRepository` and `VacationRepository` were implemented to interact with the database.
   - The **Services** contain business logic and abstract the interaction between controllers and repositories. The `IVacationService` and `VacationService` services provide methods for managing vacation requests.
   - **Controllers** expose APIs to handle requests from the user interface.

2. **Database Integration**: 
   - The system uses **SQL Server** for the backend database, with **Entity Framework Core** for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). 
   - The application utilizes code-first migration to generate database schemas based on the defined models.
   
3. **Code Management in GitHub Codespace**:
   - The entire project was developed and stored in a GitHub repository (`LubnaNedhalAbdAlRahimKanan`), using **GitHub Codespaces** for a cloud-based development environment.
   - Through Codespaces, I ensured that the project was initialized with proper Git settings, and pushed all changes to the GitHub repository.

4. **Adding Migrations**:
   - I successfully added **code-first migrations** for generating the initial database schema and ensuring that the database structure is in sync with the defined models.
   
5. **Swagger for API Documentation**: 
   - To enhance development and testing, **Swagger** was integrated into the application, allowing easy documentation of the APIs for employee and vacation management.

6. **Deployment and Future Enhancements**: 
   - The system is ready for future feature additions like enhanced reporting, vacation type management, employee management, and integration with external systems.

The project has been successfully stored in the GitHub repository, leveraging GitHub Codespaces for smooth cloud-based development, and it ensures effective management of employee vacation requests and workflow.
